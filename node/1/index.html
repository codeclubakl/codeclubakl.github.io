<pre>
Currently, when you click 'submit' on the post.html page, you are taken
 to a new page that says "Thanks for your idea"

This is confusing and not very attractive.

After this change, when you click submit,
1. you stay on the same page
2. a little box pops up that says "Thanks! Your idea was saved!"

All these changes are in post.html


Act 1
- [ ] You will need to include jQuery in the page if it is not already included.
(Google it! Or look in the head of the feed.html for an example to copy. It's
one line of html code, and it goes in the page head)

Use jQuery to make something happen when you submit the form. To do this:

- [ ] in the html, add a class to the &lt;form> so we can find it using
 javascript
- [ ] add a pair of &lt;script> </script> tags so we can add some javascript.
Add these near the end of the file, just above &lt;/body> and &lt;/html>
- [ ] use jquery to find the form in the html, using its class name. (Do you
 remember this from the activities?). In the star activity we made things
 happen on click. Here we want to make things happen on "submit", so you'll
 end up with a line of code like this:

```
$("formclassname").on("submit", myCoolFunction);
```

- [ ] make a function that will be called when the form is submitted.

```
var myCoolFunction = function (e) {
    preventDefault();
}
```

The line 'preventDefault' disables the browser's built in action
(which is to go to a new page).

TEST: clicking 'submit' should now do nothing!

Act 2:

history lesson (you can skip this):
Currently, this page works using an old school technique from before JavaScript
 was a thing. In the HTML is a form. A form is just like a paper form - you
  fill it in. When you press 'Submit', your browser takes all the things you
  wrote, puts them together into a message, and POSTs it to the address
  specified at the top of the form. Then your browser waits for the response
   from the server. When it arrives, it displays the response
    ("Thanks for your idea").

In your new function:

- [ ] Look up how to POST using jQuery.
- [ ] Use jquery to POST to the address "/ideas".
- [ ] Get the user's idea from the HTML so you can post it
- [ ] Include the user's idea in the post `{idea: userIdea}`
- [ ] check that the idea now appears on the ideas feed

Act 3: show feedback
- [ ] Add an empty div to the page with a special class like 'note' i.e.
 &lt;div class="note">&lt;/div>
- [ ] In your function, tell jquery to select that div and change the text
 inside it to say "Thanks! Your idea was submitted!" using some code like this:

  $(".note").text("Thanks! Your idea was submitted");

Act 4: show the server's feedback
actually we're not going to do this right now
